## Technical description of the attack
â€‹This query collects LDAP queries executed on domain controllers monitored by Defender for Identity. The filter attributes of these queries are extracted and matched against a list of IOCs obtained from popular reconnaissance tools.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
During the reconnaissance phase attackers attempt to enumerate information on the Active Directory structure by using various LDAP-based discovery queries to identify targets for attack. Popular tools that perform this type of LDAP-based discovery are Sharphound (part of Bloodhound) and AD Explorer.


## Considerations
The list of IOCs should be periodically updated when new reconnaissance tools are released.


## False Positives
Some legitimate administration tools will also perform LDAP queries that are identified as reconnaissance.


## Suggested Response Actions
Investigate if the user running these queries has a legitimate business use for making these queries.


## Detection Blind Spots
This query will only find LDAP queries that are logged by Microsoft Defender for Identity.
