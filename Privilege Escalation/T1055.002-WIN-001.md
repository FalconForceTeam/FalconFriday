## Technical description of the attack\
The query searches for unsigned processes with a low GlobalPrevalence that inject into other processes. This technique is commonly used by multiple attacker toolkits.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
This rule detects the use of the NtAllocateVirtualMemoryRemote API call that is registered by MDE. The is a legitimate use for this, however when executed by a rare binary which is unsigned as well should be very uncommon.


## Considerations
Processes can be injected into in various different ways, this detection only focusses on the variant utilizing the NtAllocateVirtualMemoryRemote API call.


## False Positives
None expected.


## Suggested Response Actions
Validate the InitiatingProcessFolderPath and InitiatingProcessFileName and its commandline for known behavior. Investigate the host for other suspicious behavior. A common side signal for this would be a handle to the process with PROCESS_VM_WRITE permissions. Currently MDE only records this for the lsass.exe process.


## Detection Blind Spots
When the GlobalPrevalence of the used tool is too high this detection will not pick it up, the same is true for software signed with a validiated certificate. Additionally, when an attacker injects into a valid signed and common process through another method they will hide in the common signals.
