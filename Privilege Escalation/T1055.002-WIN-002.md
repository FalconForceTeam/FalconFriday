## Technical description of the attack
â€‹The query searches for unsigned processes with a low GlobalPrevalence that inject into other processes. This technique is commonly used by multiple attacker toolkits.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
This rule detects the use of the QueueUserApcRemoteApiCall API call that is registered by MDE. The is a legitimate use for this, however when executed by a rare binary which is unsigned as well should be very uncommon.


## Considerations
Processes can be injected into in various different ways, this detection only focusses on the variant utilizing the QueueUserApcRemoteApiCall API call.


## False Positives
None expected.


## Suggested Response Actions
The process injection coming coming from the following sources will not be detected:
  - A DLL started by Rundll32.
  - A DLL which is hijacked, running inside a trusted process.
  - A COM object which lives inside a trusted process, such as dllhost.exe.
  - Using AppInit_DLL to load your malicious DLL inside a trusted process.
  - Use shims to load your malicious DLL inside a trusted process.


## Detection Blind Spots
When the GlobalPrevalence of the used tool is too high this detection will not pick it up, the same is true for software signed with a validiated certificate. Additionally, when an attacker injects into a valid signed and common process through another method they will hide in the common signals.
