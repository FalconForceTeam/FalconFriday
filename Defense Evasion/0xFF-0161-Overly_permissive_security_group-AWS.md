## Technical description of the attack
â€‹This query detects someone setting a security group with inbound rules allowing 0.0.0.0 or a subnet less than or equal to /16. It does it similarly with ipv6.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
An attacker on AWS might want to obtain access to a machine via SSH, RDP or another management protocol. Since properly configured servers are not internet-reachable, attackers have been observed to allow-list a very large range to provide themselves access to the resource.


## Considerations
This rule only works for organizations which adhere to a strict policy with regards to "least privilege" access.


## False Positives
This rule can trigger a significant number of false positives. It's necessary to tune this rule per organization to ensure that it matches the organization-specific modus operandi with regards to security groups.


## Suggested Response Actions
Confirm if the user has indeed created an overly broad security group rule.


## Detection Blind Spots
None known.
