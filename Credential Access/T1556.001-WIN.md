## Technical description of the attack
​This query uses IIS logs to identify certificates requested via the web interface. In the first step, ADCS servers are listed by looking for an ADCS specific Uri Stem in the IIS logs events. A hard-coded ADCS server list can also be provided as client variable instead (adcs_server_list). In a second step, requests to these servers done via the web interface are identified by looking for POST to a '/certsrv/certfnsh.asp' Uri.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
This query looks for ADCS certificates being requested via the web interface. This technique can be used by an attacker to modify authentication processes, in order to evade detection or elevate privileges.


## Considerations
This action is not malicious on its own, but should be quite rare. This event must be correlated with other events.


## False Positives
This rule will create noise if the web interface is a common way to request certificates in a given environment.


## Suggested Response Actions
investigate whether the affected user requested the certificate for a valid business purpose.


## Detection Blind Spots
None expected.
