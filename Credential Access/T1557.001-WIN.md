## Technical description of the attack
â€‹This query searches for successful NTLM network logins where the device name contained in the NTLM authentication message contains a device that is known to MDE, but the source IP address is different from the known source IP address for that specific device. This could indicate an attacker is relaying the NTLM authentication information. To remove false positives, this query also searches for an outgoing network connection from the initiator to the attacker.

## Detection description
NTLM relay attacks can be used by an attacker to authenticate to a system by relaying NTLM credentials that are taken from a different system. In an NTLM relay attack three machines are involved: the initiator, the attacker and the target. The initiator initiates an NTLM session to the attacker, the attacker then relays the NTLM authentication information to the target.


## Considerations
None.


## False Positives
None expected.


## Suggested Response Actions
The query results can be used as a starting point for further investigations. The RemoteIP in the results contains the attacker's IP address.


## Detection Blind Spots
The rule will only work if both the initiator and the target machines are enrolled in MDE.
