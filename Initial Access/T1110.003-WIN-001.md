## ATT&CK Tags
**Tactic:** Initial Access

**Technique:** Brute Force: Password Spraying

## Technical description of the attack
The query searches for failed logins from a single source towards multiple different accounts and provides three parameters to tune
the results for your specific environment. The full details of the working are described in the blog post linked above.
 

## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
A password spraying attack is detected, where a single machine has performed a large number of failed login attempts, with a large number of different accounts. For each account, the attacker uses just a few attempts to prevent account lockout. This query uses the DeviceLogonEvents per machine to detect a password spraying attacks. The machine against which the password spraying is performed (can be DC, a server or even an endpoint) needs to be enrolled in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. 

## Utilized Data Source
| Event ID | Event Name | Log Provider | ATT&CK Data Source |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| - | DeviceLogonEvents | MDE |  |


## Hunt details
### KQL

**FP Rate:** *Medium*

**Source:** *MDE*

**Description:** *See above*

**Query:**

```C#
let thresholdForUniqueFailedAccounts = 20;
let upperBoundOfFailedLogonsPerAccount = 10;
let ratioSuccessFailedLogons = 0.5;
let timeframe = 1d;
DeviceLogonEvents
| where Timestamp >= ago(timeframe)
| where LogonType != "Unlock" and ActionType in ("LogonSuccess", "LogonFailed")
| where not(isempty( RemoteIP) and isempty( RemoteDeviceName))
| extend LocalLogon=parse_json(AdditionalFields)
| where RemoteIPType != "Loopback"
| summarize SuccessLogonCount = countif(ActionType == "LogonSuccess"), FailedLogonCount = countif(ActionType == "LogonFailed"),
    UniqueAccountFailedLogons=dcountif(AccountName, ActionType == "LogonFailed"), FirstFailed=minif(Timestamp, ActionType == "LogonFailed"),
    LastFailed=maxif(Timestamp, ActionType == "LogonFailed"), LastTimestamp=arg_max(Timestamp, tostring(ReportId)) by RemoteIP, DeviceName //Remote IP is here the source of the logon attempt.
| project-rename IPAddress=RemoteIP
| where UniqueAccountFailedLogons > thresholdForUniqueFailedAccounts and SuccessLogonCount*ratioSuccessFailedLogons < FailedLogonCount and UniqueAccountFailedLogons*upperBoundOfFailedLogonsPerAccount > FailedLogonCount 
```

## Considerations
* This query needs tuning for your environment. A short guide is provided in the blog post linked above. 
* This query only detects password spraying against endpoints which are enrolled in MDE.  

## False Positives
*  
  

## Detection Blind Spots
*
