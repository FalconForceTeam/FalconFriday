## ATT&CK Tags

**Tactic:** Persistence

**Technique:** Browser Extensions (T1176)
​

## Technical description of the attack
​
An attacker can install its own or infect a highjacked browser extension to gain persistence and control over a system. Depending on the intent of the attacker he can have full control over all communication the browser has, execute new processes, have a stable command and control channel and much more.

## Permission required to execute the technique

User

## Detection description

Whenever an extension is installed or updated several files are created in the extension folder. We utilize the events generated by this activity to enable us to capture the ExtensionID.

The most common ones are autmented with an ExtensionName field, the unknown ones are left empty, you should validate those and ideally monitor them for changes to their capabilities. A great resource for this is [CRXcavator](https://crxcavator.io/)

## Utilized Data Source
| Event ID | Event Name | Log Provider | ATT&CK Data Source |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|

## Hunt details

### KQL
**FP Rate:** *Low*

**Source:** *MDE*

**Description:** *First a recerence list is created with known/fairly trusted extensions. Next the new file create events are filtered and the ExtensionID is regexed from the path which is joined with the KnownExtensions reference list*

**Query:**

```C#
let KnownExtensions = datatable(ExtensionName:string, ExtensionId:string)

## Considerations

* An attacker or malicious insider can side-load extensions, potentially spoofing the ExtensionId of a known/trusted extension. In order to be able to do so the browser needs to be in developer mode.
* An attacker can modify extensions that are already installed, you could have a look at other InitiatingProcessFileName processes that access this folder. You will see explorer and dllhost as very common processes.

## False Positives

Extensions that are trusted by your environment

## Detection Blind Spots

Non Chromium based browsers are obviously not supported in this query.
