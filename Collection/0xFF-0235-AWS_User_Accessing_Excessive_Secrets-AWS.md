## Technical description of the attack
â€‹This query searches for an account which accesses a large number of secrets from various sources in AWS, including SSM secrets and instance passwords.


## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
When an attacker gains access to an account with access to AWS,they might abuse that account to view secrets stored in the AWS cloud.


## Considerations
None.


## False Positives
There might be user accounts that access large numbers of secrets for business purposes. For example, an account associated with a remote management tool. These accounts have be filtered.


## Suggested Response Actions
Confirm if the user responsible for the account that triggered this alert is aware of the attempts to access secrets.


## Detection Blind Spots
None known.

## Detection

**Language:** Kusto

**Platform:** Sentinel

**Query:**
```C#
let timeframe = 1h;
let time_period = 10m;
let access_threshold = 10;
// The rule will trigger when more than access_threshold secrets are requested in time_period.
AWSCloudTrail
| where ingestion_time() >= ago(timeframe)
| where EventName in ("GetPasswordData","GetSecretValue","Decrypt")
| extend SecretId=case(
    EventName == "GetPasswordData", parse_json(RequestParameters).instanceId,
    EventName == "GetSecretValue", parse_json(RequestParameters).secretId,
    EventName == "Decrypt", coalesce(parse_json(parse_json(RequestParameters).encryptionContext).SecretARN, parse_json(parse_json(RequestParameters).encryptionContext).PARAMETER_ARN)
    , ""
)
// For Decrypt only look at decryption of SSM secrets.
| where EventName != "Decrypt" or SecretId startswith "arn:aws:ssm"
| summarize arg_min(TimeGenerated, *), SecretCount=count(), Secrets=make_set(SecretId) by UserIdentityArn, TimeBin=bin(TimeGenerated, time_period)
| where SecretCount > access_threshold
// Begin client-specific filter.
// End client-specific filter.
```
