## Technical description of the attack
â€‹This rule looks for Named Pipe events that either contain one of the known IOCs or make use of patterns that can be linked to CobaltStrike usage.

## Permission required to execute the technique
User

## Detection description
Cobalt Strike is used as a post-exploitation tool with various malware droppers responsible for the initial infection stage. Named pipes are used to send the output of the post-exploitation tools to the beacon. Cobalt Strike is using default unique pipe names, which defenders can use for detection. However, Cobalt Strike allows the operators to change the name of the pipes to any name of their choosing by configuring the malleable C2 profile accordingly.

## Considerations
None

## False Positives
None expected.

## Suggested Response Actions
Investigate this host immediately, when the pipe name and originating process look suspicious isolate the machine and validate where the file came from and where the host has been communicating.

## Detection Blind Spots
Pipe names outside of the queried names.
