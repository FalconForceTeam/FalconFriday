## Technical description of the attack
​
An attacker can use this binary for the following techniques;
* T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer
* T1564.004 - Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes
* T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information
* T1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

## Permission required to execute the technique

## Detection description

This detection addresses most of the known ways to utilize this binary for malicious/unintended purposes. It attempts to accomodate for most detection evasion techniques, like commandline obfuscation and binary renaming

## Utilized Data Source

| Event ID | Event Name | Log Provider | ATT&CK Data Source |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| - | DeviceProcessEvents | MDE | Process Monitoring |
| - | DeviceFileEvents | MDE | File metadata |

## Hunt details

### KQL

**FP Rate:** *Low*

**Source:** *MDE*

**Description:** *This detection addresses most of the known ways to utilize this binary for malicious/unintended purposes. It attempts to accomodate for most detection evasion techniques, like commandline obfuscation and binary renaming*
**Query:**

```C#
// set the time span for the query
let Timeframe = 30d;
// set the HashTimeframe for the hash lookup, longer makes more accurate but obviously also more resource intensive
let HashTimeframe = 30d;
// Get all known SHA1 hashes for certutil executions or renamed files formerly named certutil
let CertUtilPESha1=DeviceProcessEvents | where Timestamp > ago(HashTimeframe)| where FileName contains "certutil"  | where isnotempty(SHA1) | summarize sha1=make_set(SHA1);
let CertUtilFESha1=DeviceFileEvents | where Timestamp > ago(HashTimeframe)| where PreviousFileName contains "certutil" or FileName contains "certutil"  | where isnotempty(SHA1) | summarize sha1=make_set(SHA1);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(Timeframe)
// get all executions by processes with a SHA1 hash that is or was named certutil
| where SHA1 in (CertUtilPESha1) or SHA1 in (CertUtilFESha1) or FileName =~ "certutil.exe" or ProcessCommandLine has_any ("certutil")
// create a new field called CleanProcessCommandLine which gets populated with the value of ProcessCommandLine as Windows parses it for execution, 
// removing any potential command line obfuscation 
| extend CleanProcessCommandLine=parse_command_line(ProcessCommandLine, "windows")
// search for de-obfuscated commands used 
| where CleanProcessCommandLine has_any ("decode", "encode", "verify","url") 
// urlcache is the documented attribute, only url is also accepted
// verifyctl is the documented attribute, only verify is also accepted
| order by Timestamp
| project Timestamp, CleanProcessCommandLine, ProcessCommandLine, SHA1
```

## Considerations

* Take into account that there are always bypasses possible. 
* For the download technique you could match it to DeviceNetworkEvents that connect to the internet for more contextual information

## False Positives
* Defender For Endpoint Client Analyzer (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/download-client-analyzer?view=o365-worldwide) uses Certultil to verify the certificate ```"certutil.exe" -verify -urlfetch <FolderPath>\MDEClientAnalyzer\Tools\winatp.cer```.
